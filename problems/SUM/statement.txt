Problem: SUM

Limits:
Time=1s, Memory=256mb

Statement:
You have "n" queries to process. Each query contains positive integers "l" and "r". Respond with the sum of all integers between "l" and "r" inclusive.

Input Format:
First line contains integer "n" (1<=n<=1e6).
Next "n" lines each contain integer "l" and "r" (1<=l<r<=1e9).

Output Format:
For each query, output a single integer which is the sum of all integers between "l" and "r" inclusive.

Sample Input:
2
1 4
2 3

Sample Output:
10
5

Sample Explanation:
For query 1, "l" is 1 and "r" is 4. Therefore the answer is 1+2+3+4 = 10
For query 2, "l" is 2 and "r" is 3. Therefore the answer is 2+3 = 5
